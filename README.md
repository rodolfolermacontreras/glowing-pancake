# Problem:
Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, create a new notebook to build a TensorlLow model.


# Abstract:
You start working for a new startup building the next generation search engine. The search engine provides the ability to search images with their content. You are tasked to build a machine learning model that is able to identify the objects in images. The model you are building will help in providing the capability to search for 10 objects. Download the L09_ImageClasses.pdf to see a list of the classes in the dataset and 10 random images from each class.

For this project you will use the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The analysis is is divided the following way:

### Data Exploration
- **Background information**
- **Loading data**
- **Formatting names of target variable**
- **Example of the data for the model**

### Analysis
- **Models**
    - Options for some Hyperparaters
    - Based Model
    - Adjusted Model
    - Prediction examples
          
### Summary of Findings
